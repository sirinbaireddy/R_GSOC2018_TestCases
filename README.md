# R_GSOC2018_TestCases
Test Cases for the PeakSegPipeline Project

Easy: download the PeakSegPipeline package and run test-pipeline-demo.R on your own computer. 

Medium: demonstrate that you know how to use docker images, which you will need to use in GSOC to test PeakSegPipeline on different systems. Inside of a windows docker image, try installing PeakSegPipeline â€“ what happens?

Hard: look through the source code and explain which parts you think will need to be changed so that the code works on Win/Mac.
