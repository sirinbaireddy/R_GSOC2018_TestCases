# R_GSOC2018_TestCases
Test Cases for the SAGA sparse linear models Project

Easy: use glmnet to compute a L1-regularized linear model of the spam data in library(ElemStatLearn). What features are selected for the prediction function?

Medium: compute timings of glmnet (with alpha=0) and bigoptim for data sets (feature matrices) with varying number of rows and columns. Plot timings versus number of rows and columns â€“ which is faster? Which is more accurate, in terms of objective function values? (smaller is better)

Hard: write an R package with a simple C++ function.
