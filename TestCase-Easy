The task is to use glmnet to compute a L1-regularized linear model of the spam data in the  library "ElemStatLearn". 
Then I add what features are selected for the prediction function.

The first step was importing the data from the internet to a dataset I can edit with R. 
I did this by accessing the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/)
I downloaded the data set with 
> dataSet <- read.table(file.choose(), header = T, sep = ",")
> View(dataSet)
